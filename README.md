# Kingfishers Media℠ Learn to Earn Program

**Education is not only a public good with it's unlimited supply, but is also considered a Real World Asset**

The mission of Kingfishers Media℠ is to inspire, excite, educate, & motivate people to support the regeneration of knowledge.

As we continue our infrastructure buildout we are evaluating tokenizing education from the certification aspect.

* **Bringing Course Completion & Certifications onchain**
    * Verify course completion through EAS (Ethereum Attestation Service) primitives
    * Develop an internal custom token reward per course or live session completed
    * Cumulative attestations and rewards represented by a singular onchain ERC-1155 deployed on Optimism
